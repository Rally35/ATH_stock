# 🚀 Next Steps Roadmap

You've completed the foundation! Here's your path forward:

## ✅ What You Have Now

1. **Database Infrastructure** ✓
   - PostgreSQL with optimized schema
   - Historical prices loaded
   - Technical indicators calculated

2. **Data Coverage** ✓
   - Multiple years of historical data
   - RSI, MACD, SMA, EMA, ATR
   - All-time high tracking

3. **Tools** ✓
   - Data loader (`load_data.py`)
   - Indicator calculator (`calculate_indicators.py`)
   - Database management (`manage_database.py`)

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

### Step 1: Analyze Your Data (TODAY)
```bash
python3 analyze_stocks.py
```

**What it does:**
- Shows current momentum signals
- Identifies stocks near all-time highs
- Finds recent golden crosses
- Gives you actionable insights RIGHT NOW

**Expected output:**
- List of stocks with momentum signals
- Stocks within 5% of ATH
- Trend changes in last 60 days

---

### Step 2: Run Your First Backtest (TODAY)
```bash
python3 backtest_simple.py
```

**What it tests:**
- Your momentum strategy on historical data
- Entry: RSI > 50, SMA50 > SMA200, within 5% of ATH
- Exit: Signal disappears or 2x ATR stop loss
- Position sizing based on ATR risk

**You'll learn:**
- Does the strategy actually work?
- What's the win rate?
- Maximum drawdown?
- Sharpe ratio?

**Example output:**
```
Performance Metrics:
  Initial Capital:     100,000.00 PLN
  Final Capital:       127,500.00 PLN
  Total Return:             27.50%
  Max Drawdown:             -8.20%
  Win Rate:                 65.00%
```

---

### Step 3: Review & Adjust (THIS WEEK)

After running backtest, ask yourself:
- Is the win rate acceptable? (Target: >50%)
- Is drawdown manageable? (Target: <20%)
- Are there enough trading opportunities?
- Which stocks perform best?

---

## 📅 Phase 2: Optimization (Week 2-3)

### Option A: Improve Strategy Parameters

Create `optimize_parameters.py` to test:
- Different RSI thresholds (45, 50, 55, 60)
- ATH proximity (3%, 5%, 10%)
- Stop loss distances (1.5x, 2x, 2.5x ATR)
- Position sizing rules

### Option B: Add Filters & Confirmations

Enhance strategy with:
- Volume confirmation (volume > 1.5x average)
- Minimum liquidity requirements
- Sector rotation analysis
- Market regime filters (bull vs bear)

### Option C: Advanced Indicators

Calculate additional signals:
- Bollinger Bands for volatility
- On-Balance Volume (OBV)
- Rate of Change (ROC)
- Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)

---

## 📊 Phase 3: Advanced Analysis (Week 4+)

### 1. **Walk-Forward Analysis**
Test strategy on rolling time windows:
- Train on 2020-2022
- Test on 2023
- Train on 2021-2023
- Test on 2024

Prevents overfitting!

### 2. **Monte Carlo Simulation**
Understand risk:
- 1000+ random trade sequences
- Probability of 20%+ drawdown?
- Worst-case scenarios

### 3. **Portfolio Optimization**
Determine:
- Optimal number of positions
- Capital allocation per stock
- Correlation between holdings
- Rebalancing frequency

---

## 🔨 Phase 4: Production System (Month 2+)

### 1. **Live Signal Generation**
Create `generate_signals.py`:
- Runs daily after market close
- Identifies new momentum setups
- Sends alerts (email/Telegram/Discord)
- Logs signals to database

### 2. **Paper Trading**
Track hypothetical trades:
- Follow signals in real-time
- Record fills and slippage
- Compare to backtest results
- Build confidence before live trading

### 3. **Risk Management System**
Implement:
- Portfolio heat (total risk exposure)
- Position correlation limits
- Maximum loss per day/week/month
- Emergency exit procedures

### 4. **Performance Tracking**
Build dashboard:
- Current positions
- P&L tracking
- Strategy vs benchmark
- Execution quality metrics
